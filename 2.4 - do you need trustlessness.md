# Do you need trustlessness?

Most computer systems rely on a central trusted party. When you send an email through Gmail or Outlook, you are trusting Google and Microsoft not to tamper with your messages. Likewise if you make a phone call through your mobile carrier network, you are trusting them to connect you to the right person and not to alter or spy on your conversation.

Trustlessness means the distribution of trust from a central player to the system itself. The idea behind a trustless system is that you do not need to trust on the say so of an authority to be sure that the system is obeying the rules.
