# Do you need a ledger?

The word ledger traditionally means a *financial accounting system*, examples of ledgers include:

- an excel spreadsheet keeping track of a budget
- the administration of a store's stock and its value
- a bank's internal system for keeping track how much money depositors have in their accounts

A blockchain is a type of ledger: it is a way of keeping track who owns what[^For those of you that know the difference between an account based ledger and one using UTXOs, please don't tweet at me how the below is technically not correct.]. In this chapter we'll cover a simplified version of in what way a blockchain is a ledger and what that means for its usefulness.

> Ledgers are everywhere. Airmiles? That's a ledger keeping track of who has how many points. Grades at school? That's a ledger keeping score of how well students are doing at tests. Upvotes on social media platforms? That's a ledger keeping track of the "score" of a post.

## Bitcoin: a ledger of who owns BTC

Take Bitcoin as an example of a blockchain system. It is a system comprised of software that securely makes available a way to see who owns which BTC tokens, and for the owners of the tokens to send them to someone else.

The Bitcoin blockchain is a spreadsheet with some extra cryptographic superpowers attached, but in it's essence it:

- allows everyone to read it
- synchronises changes to the spreadsheet across computers (like Google Docs)
- allows only owners of a row in the spreadsheet to make edits to it

The Bitcoin spreadsheet has 2 columns:

1. Column A is "account number"
2. Column B is "current balance"

The cryptographic spice to this system is that making a change to a row requires a cryptographic key, which just means only the person with the cryptographic key (which looks like a long password, it's just text) can make changes.

If for example I own the cryptographic key to row 5 of the spreadsheet, I can open the Bitcoin software and tell it:

1. Hello, I own row 5, you can see so because I own the key that corresponds to the account number in spreadsheet cell 5A
2. As you can see, row 5B shows I have 0.001 BTC
3. I want to transfer 0.0005 from 5B to my friend Robin who owns row 10, you can see the account number in cell 10A, please add the 0.0005 to their balance in 10B

The Bitcoin software will then check if the cryptographic key I present is correct, and if so it will add the transfer to the next **block**.

> Public ledgers like Bitcoin are not anonymous. In fact, all transactions are public. This has lead to multiple cases where law enforcement agencies have been able to unrefutably accuse people who earned Bitcoin by the sale of drugs on darknet market places. This includes for example a [US resident who is accused of selling $19 million worth of drugs](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/23/man-accused-of-laundering-millions-in-bitcoin-from-silk-road.html). Regardless of the specifics of the case, one thing that the police will have an easy time proving is where the Bitcoin the man owns comes from. He reputedly claimed he mined it (a process of generating Bitcoin by spending money on machines and electricity), but in the public "spreadsheet" it was very easy to see the money was sent form the known wallet address of the darknet marketplace Silkroad.

## A block is an updated spreadsheet

Every time a blockchain "spreadsheet" makes an update, it keeps the old version of the sheet and adds a new one to the list. The process is roughly:

1. Take the current sheet, called "sheet number 6" (I'm making up the number)
2. Make the new spreadsheet that includes all the changes people requested over the past 5 minutes
3. Call the new spreadsheet "sheet number 7" and make the first line of the new sheet "this sheet comes after sheet 6, look at sheet 6 to see why this sheet is the way it is"

In blockchain world we don't use the word "new sheet" to denote a batch of changes, we call then "new blocks". And when you create blocks that belong in a certain order, you might as well call it a chain of blocks. A block chain. Blockchain. Get it?

## Blockchains make strong guarantees about transaction history

One of the upsides of a system like this is that you have a complete transaction history of everyone using the system. And that transaction history can be proven to have no cheaters because you can go all the way back to spreadsheet 1 (block #1, often called "genesis block") and see if the spreadsheets leading up to the one in front of you contain any errors.

If the above analogy of blockchains as spreadsheets makes you go "that sounds awfully fraud-prone and easy to cheat", rest assured that I left out the bits to do with elliptic curve cryptography and hashing functions. For the purposes of understanding the use of a blockchain, the spreadsheet analogy works well. The underlying security however is more complex, and more importantly: not relevant when trying to figure out whether a blockchain is useful in a given context.

## Ethereum: a spreadsheet with functions and macros

Another big blockchain is Ethereum, which unlike Bitcoin is not purely a "who owns what" ledger. Like an excel spreadsheet you are used to, it can do more advanced logic.

You can think of Bitcoin like a basic spreadsheet, and Ethereum like an advanced spreadsheet of the type that a financial analyst might use: it can do more advanced computations like functions and macros[^For the uninitiated: modern spreadsheets have many hidden functions that allow them to do almost anything. A sufficiently skilled spreadsheet user can in many cases get close to a data scientist who uses "real" programming languages to do their computations.].

For the programmers among you: Ethereum is Turing complete. For the non-programmers among you: that means you can create almost any computer program you can think of with it. Examples that have been created with Ethereum are:

- banks: or more specifically a lending platform that lends out money without human intervention
- insurance: in a cooperative sense where everyone pays into a pot and insurance claims are paid out if more than a certain percentage of people agree the claim is legit
- asset trading exchanges: similar to stock exchanges only it completely runs itself

The above examples manifest themselves as self-running computer code on their blockchain. Like a spreadsheet where once you've added new rules to it, columns all over the sheet can update when you change one of them.

> A friend of mine once did a freelance assignment for a bank. It turned out that the bank had not updated its systems for a while and was using Microsoft Excel as their ledger to keep track of customer accounts. Not only that, the sheets they used had many complex and undocumented macros, and the spreadsheet would only work on a very specific version of Excel. Just because something can be a ledger doesn't mean it's the right one...

## If you don't need a ledger, you don't need a blockchain

If you need a ledger, you might have use for a blockchain. It's not the only type of ledger, so needing a ledger not sufficient reason to use a blockchain.

The inverse however is more useful, if you do not need a ledger, you don't need a blockchain:

- An image-generating AI powered by blockchain? That's like saying "an AI powered by a spreadsheet"
- Using a blockchain to privately send secure messages? Well, would you send message in a public Google Sheet? I'm not saying it can't be done, but I have many questions
- Powering next-gen games using a blockchain? Unlikely, you wouldn't run a game on excel either. That's not to say you can't use blockchains to run a small part of the game (e.g. who owns what items), but it can only ever be small part of your digital infrastructure
- Using blockchains to revolutionise healthcare? Well maybe, but if you need a ledger in healthcare you're probably better off using excel

This is only one of the aspects of a blockchain of course, but if a use case can't clear the simple bar of "do you need a ledger", then you probably shouldn't be using a blockchain.

## Example: USDC stable coin

The USDC stable coin is a crypto token that has a simple use case: one USDC is worth one dollar. Every USDC token is backed by dollar value in a traditional bank account owned by the company behind USDC: Circle.

Leave aside whether a token like this is a good idea. From a technical standpoint we can at the very least say that a blockchain is a tool that is relevant to USDC as a product: the main thing we care about with USDC is who owns what. Which is what a ledger is useful for.

The fact that USDC tokens tend to live on Turing complete blockchains like Ethereum means that the Circle company is able to give themselves some special permissions to for example freeze funds.
