# Epilogue

This book has covered my framework for looking at blockchain technology applications. I tried to steer away from my opinion on more hot-button topics that tend to come up when blockchains are the topic of conversation. I know I will get many questions about those things if I don't address them briefly. So in this epilogue I'll cover some of my views on the more controversial aspects of blockchains.

Please note that everything in this section is:

- my opinion as of mid 2023
- subject to change as I learn more
- not intended to tell you what to think or do

Please enjoy what my fellow internet friends call my "unpopular opinions".

## Financial bubbles are a feature, not a bug

My academic background is mostly in biology. I get paid to write code, but I like to think in metaphores of biological systems. A "function" in programming? Like a ribosome: in go the ~~RNA and amino acids~~ parameters, out come the ~~protein~~ return value. Financial markets, including the crypto markets, are no different: you can view them as ecologies of organisms.

Financial bubbles tend not to be loved, and terms like the "boom and bust cycle" and "tulip mania" are synonymous for the folly of humans. We keep getting tricked into getting over-excited about a new technology, investing crazy money in it, and then watching it all burn. You know what I see in financial bubbles? The Galapagos islands.

The Galapagos islands inspired Darwin to formulate the theory of evolution, he looked around at the crazy animals and plants there and thought: no way this could have happened in different conditions. And in the 21st century we take for granted that isolated habitats with unique properties give rise to unique species. And those species persist after those conditions end (provided the new conditions are not hostile).

Financial bubbles are like little Galapagos islands, unique habitats where crazy amounts of money go to crazy ideas. Take some historical financial bubbles well known in the west:

- In 18th century England the South Sea bubble saw a stock hype around a slave trade effort
- In the US, the 19th century railroad bubble caused massive overinvestment into the railroad sector
- The 20th century saw the birth of the dot-com bubble that fueled irrational investment into internet companies

The list above prompts two thoughts in my personally:

1. I'm not convinced we'd have globalisation, railroad networks, and a developed internet if not for these bubbles
2. We should keep strengthening the guardrails of human dignity internationally, especially in financial bubbles[^For those not familiar with the above financial bubbles, the first one traded in humans. The second saw great mistreatment of immigrant groups building infrastructure, and the last has a more hidden human cost of mining what we now call "conflict minerals" under what our western sensibilities would firmly call inhumane curcumstances.]

Financial bubbles are little Galapagos islands in time where we collectively overinvest in something. Sometimes that leads to very expensive tulip bulbs. Sometimes it gives us the internet. We never know which beforehand, because before the bubble nobody would invest in it, and only after the bubble do we pretend that the path of progress was inevitable.

I'll add one more example because it has an analogy to our present: much of our technology stems from the cold war space race. I'd comfortably argue this was a financial bubble within government administration. What is more hype and dream fueled behaviour than racing to the moon just because you can? The reason you have GPS is because a bunch of men decided to engage in a pissing contest over who could get to the moon first.

Four consecutive US presidents kept it going. A game befitting of hormone addled teenagers. Only they had the budget of global superpowers at their disposal.

"Last one there is a rotten egg".

Think about that. Really.

## Western people overestimate international trust

A good portion of people hear about the characteristics of blockchains, and seem not to see the point. Why spend so much effort to send magic internet money when you can just use your bank? Didn't we set up a global financial system for this? Why on earth would people even use stable coins aside from fraud? We already have "digital money" as evidenced by the app on my phone? Even d
