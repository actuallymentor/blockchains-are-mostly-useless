# Do you need permissionlessness?

Most computer systems are permissioned. What that means is that different actors have different rights to do different things. The computer you use for work, might, for example, have three accounts:

- one for you, which is allowed to use the computer for work activity, but not to install new software
- one guest account that can be used by anyone who has the computer in their hands, but can only browse the internet
- one tech support account, which can access all the administrative rights of the system

The opposite of a permissioned system is a permissionless system. In a permissionless system, everyone has the same capabilities. Instead of permissionless, you could describe it as "permissioned the same for anyone".

## Everyone can read public blockchains

Permissionless blockchains allow anyone to read all activity on them in real-time. This is a complete paradigm shift compared to most legacy systems. Take these examples:

- stock transaction data is very valuable and only accessible to organisations that pay a lot of money for it
- the APIs of banks[^Which would allow software developers to easily build apps that connect to your bank account] are notoriously hard to get access to, often requiring a lengthy, bureaucratic, and stringent application process
- ownership and reputation databases tend to charge money for their information. Where I live, if I want the government to give me a PDF of my own company details, I need to pay the chamber of commerce money. In the US as I understand it credit scores similarly are a paid service

Contrast that to blockchain applications:

- all trading data on decentralised exchanges are public, and available to everyone under the same rules (free)
- writing code that controls money on a blockchain can be done by anyone, without asking for permission from a central administrator
- anyone can freely access ownership data about assets that live on a blockchain

Proponents of permissionlessness will say that it leads to an equal playing field, where powerful organisations have the same access to information that anyone else has.

## Anyone can write to public blockchains

Creating a new entry on a blockchain does not require special permission. Anyone who has an idea for an application that handles blockchain-based assets can do so.

This of course leads to a lot of garbage applications living on most blockchains, just like on regular app stores. And just like regular app stores, nobody is obliged to use them.

The fact that blockchains do not put up traditional barriers to entry means that a larger group of people is free to innovate ideas on them:

- a high-school student can write an application that has the powers of a bank, and nobody will stop them because they are too young
- an African citizen can create a financial application that serves the needs of a European, without needing to convince European banks they should be allowed to try
- a self-taught innovator without a degree can create financial infrastructure that competes alongside banks

While blockchains attract a lot of innovation due to their open nature, this also leads to a lot of reinventing the wheel and trying things that will never work. That however is an interesting petri dish for new ideas to emerge.

## If you don't want permissionlessness, don't use a blockchain

Not everything benefits from permissionlessness, and many useful applications are opposed to such a system.

If you're going to build a record-keeping system where you need different levels of access, you likely need permissioned systems. Imagine the tax service of a country running on a permissionless blockchain: everyone would be able to read everyone else's tax information[^Excitingly, this might change soon with the advent of zero-knowledge cryptography, but that is not entirely production-ready at the time of writing]. The same goes for storing medical data on a blockchain: that sounds like a terrible idea.

Even financial applications, which blockchains are often used for, might not want to work in a permissionless system. While open access to the trades and transfers of everyone in the world makes for a fair playing field, it is also the death of financial privacy[^Blockchains that are not specifically privacy-centric tend to ].

## Example: Proof of Attendance Protocol

At the time of writing, I am an active contributor to the [Proof of Attendance Protocol](https://poap.xyz). It is an example of the usefulness of permissionlessness. The system allows event organisers to hand out NFTs that certify someone attended an event.

This allows event organisers to do things like:

- for every soccer match you show up for, you get a POAP token. Once tickets go on sale for the season finale, those who showed up most get priority
- people who attend a concert get a POAP token, and those who attended more than 5 concerts of an artist get access to a live-streamed Q&A with the artist
- members of an online community get a POAP token for showing up for monthly community calls, and those who have more than 3 get to vote on polls that determine the direction of the community

Because these POAP tokens are registered on a blockchain as NFTs, anyone can see which crypto wallets have which POAP tokens. The permissionless nature of the blockchain on which POAP tokens are stored means anyone can:

1. determine the social track record of a crypto wallet: are they a long-standing community member? Do they engage in events you might have in common?
2. find people who match a demographic you are interested in: who is very active in Defi communities? Who goes to many in-person conferences?

This allows example applications like:

- a soccer club offering a discount to die-hard soccer fans, even if they are from another club
- giving discounts to people who donated to certain charities
- allow online communities to determine whether new members can be trusted

If you're reading this and thinking "Well all of those things existed before blockchains" you are totally right. But what storing things on a public permissionless ledger does is make these applications possible when otherwise they would be unfeasible. Let's take the example of giving discounts to people who donated to charity. How will you get people to prove they donated? Ask the charity? They won't tell you for privacy reasons. Ask them to email you a PDF of their donation receipt and pay someone to check if they look legit? Too expensive and fraud-prone.

The permissionless nature means anyone can access this data, without needing permission.
