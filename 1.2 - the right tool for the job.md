# The right tool for the job

Blockchains are useful under the same conditions when other things are: when they can do something in a way that other tools cannot do. This usually means that a tool needs to be one of these things:

- the **cheapest** way to solve a problem
- the most **convenient** way to solve a problem

Think of an F16 fighter jet. Whether it is useful is a matter of context. As a mode of transportation for example it is fast, but completely unwieldy and extremely expensive. The same can be said for a surgeon's scalpel: it is very sharp, yet nobody I know uses them to cut their food.

Perhaps when you think about it, you have used a metaphorical scalpel to cut food before. Personally, I've used spoons while gardening for example. I did so purely because the little shovel I have was too hard to reach.

## Blockchains are a specialised tool

Which means they are completely useless for most things. Compared to existing technologies, for example, they are:

- expensive to use as data storage
- slow to transfer data
- inflexible in many ways

The key to telling when blockchains are useless is to know under what specific conditions they can be useful. Because the vast majority of people who talk about using them are not using them under those conditions. They are metaphorically using scalpels to eat food and F16s to ship packages internationally.

The coming chapters present a framework to understand under which conditions a blockchain can solve a problem in a cheaper or more convenient way than other technologies.

> I was once at a hackathon (a weekend where companies convince programmers to build free product demos in return for pizza and merch), where one of the programmers told me of an app he made. He'd repurposed a social media platform as a data storage application. Much to the dismay of the social media company, he would split a movie file up into small bits and post them in a private channel. His app would then download the bits and reassemble them into a movie file. It was a clever hack, but objectively a terrible use of technology. His app was like using a scalpel to eat food. Why did he do this? Because he could. That's programmers for you.

## The five basic uses of blockchains

There are five aspects of blockchains that make them useful under specific circumstances. I remember them using the mnemonic "**LID PeT**", which I remember by visualising a dog (**PeT**) wearing a trashcan **LID** as a hat. Blockchains are:

- **L**edgers that are:
- **I**mmutable
- **D**istributed
- **Pe**rmissionless
- **T**rustless

So when figuring out whether a particular application of blockchain technology makes sense, the primary question is: do you need the above characteristics? Every special characteristic of a blockchain comes at a cost, so just because you *could* do something with a blockchain doesn't mean you should.

The following chapters will each explain what these words mean, what those things are (not) useful for, and cover some examples to illustrate.
