# The right tool for the job

Blockchains are useful under the same condition when other things are: when they can do something in a way that other tools cannot do. This usually means that a tool needs to be one of these things:

- the **cheapest** way to solve a problem
- the most **convenient** way to solve a problem

Think of an F16 fighter jet. Whether it is useful is a matter of context. As a mode of transportation for example it is fast, but completely unwieldy and extremely expensive. The same can be said for a surgeon's scalpel: it is very sharp, yet nobody I know uses them to cut their food.

## Blockchains are a specialised tool

Which means they are completely useless for most things. Compared to existing technologies for example, they are:

- expensive to use as data storage
- slow to transfer data
- inflexible in many ways

The key to telling when blockchains are bullshit, is to know under what specific conditions they can be useful. Because the vast majority of people who talk about using them are not using them under those conditions. They are metaphorically using scalpels to eat food and F16s to ship packages internationally.

The coming chapters present a framework to understand under which conditions a blockchain can solve a problem in a cheaper or more convenient way than other technologies.

## The five basic uses of blockchains

There are five aspects of blockchains that make them useful under specific circumstances. I remember them using the mnemonic "**LID PeT**", which I remember by visualising a dog (**PeT**) wearing a trashcan **LID** as a hat. Blockchains are:

- **L**edgers that are:
- **I**mmutable
- **D**istributed
- **Pe**rmissionless
- **T**rustless

So when figuring out whether a particular application of blockchain technology is bullshit, the primary question is: do you need the above characteristics? Every special characteristic of a blockchain comes at a cost, so just because you *could* do something with a blockchain doesn't mean you should.

The following chapters will each explain what these words mean, what those things are (not) useful for, and cover some examples to illustrate.
