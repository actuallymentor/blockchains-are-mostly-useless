# The goal of this book

This book aims to give you a framework with which to analyse things people say about blockchains. It is meant for those that are confronted with crypto fanatics and want a framework for telling what the ratio of truth to bullshit is in what they are saying.

This book aims to prepare you for dealing with scenarios that are common when interacting with fanatic proponents of blockchains. Common examples include:

- family members shilling you crypto investments that will "change the world"
- people trying to convince you to invest time or money into their blockchain-powered project

While the majority of this book is about spotting nonsense on the pro-blockchain side, it will inadvertently also prepare you to deal with uneducated but loud voices that are against all things blockchain. Common scenarios include:

- public personalities that claim improbable things like "crypto is the reason we have drug cartels"
- vocal technologists that claim the reason they dislike blockchains is "because they understand computerscience"

## Big fat disclaimed

This book oversimplifies blockchains. For those of you who just want to have a basic framework of how to tell when blockchains make sense, that is fine.

For those of you that are inclined to nit picking: let go of that for now. We're not going to dive into the nuances of account systems, UTXOs, permissioned chains, or how consensus algorithms work.

I've appended a list of books and resources at the end of this book if you ever want to get a technically accurate understanding of blockchains.
