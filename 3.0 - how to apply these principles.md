# How to apply these principles

The LID PeT framework gives you a few angles that allow you to assess whether an application of blockchain technology is in alignment with what the technology can and cannot do. Applying this framework is not a matter of counting up how many of the LID PeT elements are used in a particular application though. In the real world, people use things for all sorts of reasons. In this chapter, I'll cover what I think are common reasons that can make sense.

## Step 1: does it require a ledger

When you need to evaluate an application of blockchain technology, the first step is to see if the technology has anything to add at all. The only non-negotiable aspect is the L of LID PeT: Ledger. Since fundamentally blockchains are ledgers, if an application does not require a ledger it is an easy qualification. Only the most scammy or incompetent people would try to convince you their ledgerless application makes good use of blockchains. An easy trick to see if an application needs a ledger is to ask yourself "Would an Excel sheet make sense as the core of this application"[^Or if you are more technically inclined: does this application center around a database].

> The thing that I often ask startups on top of Ethereum is, 'Can you please tell me why using the Ethereum blockchain is better than using Excel?' And if they can come up with a good answer, that's when you know you've got something really interesting. ~ Vitalik Buterin

Examples that are easy to dismiss:

- a blockchain-based video streaming service - if someone tells you "I'm going to use Excel to make a Netflix competitor" you would rightfully be sceptical
- a ChatGPT competitor that uses blockchains for its computation to be more secure - if you rephrase this as "I'm using Excel to make ChatGPT more secure" it's pretty clear it's likely nonsense

Please note that needing a ledger is not a sufficient reason to use a blockchain, but not needing one is a disqualifier for sure. Here are some examples where a blockchain is at the very least not completely useless:

- a blockchain-based e-commerce platform - a company like Shopify mostly keeps track of who ordered what and who has what inventory, An Excel sheet doesn't sound out of place there
- a blockchain-powered insurance company - while you can question whether it's efficient or not, it is not unthinkable for an insurance company to keep track of insurance premiums and claims using a spreadsheet
- a blockchain-based trading card game - trading card games like Pokemon or Magic center mainly around who owns what, and using a spreadsheet is a viable way to do that

If the application you are looking at can pass this first hurdle, you can start looking at more blockchain-specific properties.

## Step 2: does it require at least one other LID PeT characteristic

Needing a ledger is not negotiable when determining whether using a blockchain can make sense. There are however many kinds of ledgers, from spreadsheets to traditional databases. The other LID PeT characteristics can also be found in other ledger types. So just because you need or want one of them, doesn't mean that blockchains are the *only* way to get them.

Needing them is, in my view, however a hurdle an application needs to pass. Otherwise, it usually makes more sense to use a traditional ledger type as they are often much easier, faster, and cheaper to use. We'll dive more into that later.

Note that needing more of the LID PeT characteristics is not better per se. Compare two fictitious applications: Butterblocks (a game) and Willow (a notary service).

Butterblocks is a video game that needs immutability, decentralisation, and permissionlessness. They have an in-game currency that they want to stimulate third-party developers to integrate into their games as well, in the hopes that their game can kick off a betterverse™️ ecosystem where many games build upon their currency. In order to do so the currency needs to be:

- tamper-proof (immutable)
- autonomous from them so other developers are not worried about them going bankrupt and the currency disappearing because their servers go down (decentralised)
- usable by third-party game developers in a way that makes them comfortable that everyone who uses the Butterblocks currency is forced to play by the same transparent rules (permissionlessness)

Willow is a company that puts authenticity proofs of wills on a blockchain. The reason they want to do this is because internationally, trust in and verification of documents is very hard. A German notary needs to do a lot of due diligence to verify that a Somali document is authentic. Their system has a fancy protocol that allows anyone to test the authenticity of a will document using the document fingerprint that can be publicly read on a blockchain. That way if you get an email from the estate of a recently deceased Nigerian prince in your email, you can validate whether the will they sent you is correct and they did not edit the will. To do this, Willow relies on a single characteristic: immutability.

Once the fingerprint of a will has been written to a blockchain, it is very important that nobody can change it. Otherwise, their whole system falls apart and nobody will be able to rely on them to validate wills. Imagine all the people who would never know if their Nigerian royal relative left them millions or billions. Not good.

Which of these two is a "better" application of LID PeT characteristics? I would venture it is Willow over Butterblocks. That is for two reasons:

1. Butterblocks could solve their problems in other ways. A clear terms of service agreement and real-time publishing of their internal ledger would make most developers comfortable that they can rely on their system. Willow on the other hand would need to build an international network of trusted agents to verify that documents were not tampered with.
2. The consequences of the Butterblocks system failing would be unfortunate, the consequences of the Willow system failing could be very painful for many people

As you can tell, the more we dive into details the more subjective things become. The main hurdle of this step is to determine that an application needs at least one ledger characteristic that blockchains provide. Whether it is a "good" application is up to your judgment and brings us to the next step.

## Step 3: is a blockchain the best way to get that characteristic?

Just because you *can* do something with a blockchain doesn't mean that you *should*. Depending on the context, you could get specific LID PeT characteristics in a better way than using a blockchain. Immutability can be achieved with many write-only media, and decentralisation is a very common paradigm in the tech world.

As I mentioned in one of the first chapters, when it comes to applying programming tools the two most important considerations are often 1) is it cheap and 2) is it convenient. Whether something is the "best" is a highly contextual matter, and subject to personal preferences and views. Instead of prescribing you specifics, I'll offer some useful lenses through which you can evaluate the usefulness of a blockchain application.

### Option 1: is it the cheapest way?

Cost is a relative term. As an example, imagine a company that wants to back up its records in a way that is public and has a low risk of disappearing. Arguably, a distributed immutable ledger could be a place to do that. However, as we discussed previously the data storage costs of traditional cloud servers are in the order of cents per GB of data, while storage on a blockchain like Ethereum is tens of thousands per GB. In this case, it is probably better to veer away from blockchains and have multiple redundant traditional backup systems.

Conversely, consider a financial institution that provides loans, perhaps a stock broker that offers margin loans to stock traders. What matters to this institution is that they know who they can provide loans to with relatively low risk. Often this is done by posting collateral:

- A stock broker will say "Hey I have $100,000 in US treasuries and want to borrow money so I can execute a stock trade"
- The financial institution will say "ok, we will let you borrow $50,000 if you promise to sell those treasuries if your stock trade goes sideways and you lose the money"

What is very important for the financial institution is that the proof that the stock broker gives that they own collateral is real. Sometimes this is simple, for example, if the stock broker has accounts at the financial institution. But sometimes this is complex, for example, if the collateral is something like ownership in a private business.

In this case, checking ownership records and taking on the counterparty risk of offering loans can be very expensive. If the verifiable records are on a blockchain, however, that would potentially be cheaper than hiring accounting firms to do due diligence.

A real-world example of this is the lending protocol [Aave](https://aave.com/). It works kind of like a pawn shop. If you own $100 of an asset, you can give it to Aave in return for $50 cash[^The specific numbers depend on market conditions, this is a fictitious example]. If you pay back your loan on time, you get your collateral back. If you don't, then Aave automatically sells your collateral so that nobody loses money except the borrower who did not keep their promise. Aave only needs to trust the underlying asset, which in the case of for example the USDC stablecoin means they only need to do due diligence on one company.

Aave can serve customers of all sizes[^At the time of writing they have $2.4 billion active loans. This fluctuates a lot based on market demand and has been much higher and much lower than that], from pocket change to many millions. The reason is that traditional counterparty risk is eliminated. The assets someone has on a blockchain are indisputable. So while storing that information on a traditional cloud server would be "cheaper", it's actually not. The money saved in auditors, borrower fraud, and so on are large enough to justify using an "expensive" medium like a blockchain to store the records[^Note that of course Aave is limited to collateral that is on blockchains. At the time of writing that is mostly cryptocurrencies, dollar-backed stablecoins, and a few commodity-linked tokens].

### Option 2: is it the most convenient way?

Suppose a company wants to build a digital platform or app. One of the choices they have to make is whether to run their application code in "the cloud" or "on-premise". In essence, they need to decide if the physical machines that run the code are going to be maintained by them in their basement or by a third-party company like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft at a large data center. Which is better? Go on Twitter and ask some developers, it's like asking "Do you like Elon Musk". You'll just end up with a lot of people arguing their personal preferences.

The fact is that technical decisions are often down to what the developer who is making them prefers. What are they familiar with? How do they like to work? Are they working alone or in a team? In the aforementioned example, the choice may be as follows:

1. The cloud option has $0 upfront cost results in a $500/month bill
2. The on-premise option has $5000 upfront cost and $50/month bill

Which is better? As a one-man start-up, I would probably choose 1 for the sake of flexibility. But perhaps if I am working within a large organisation and can have some other department set up and manage the server, I would choose option 2[^One could argue that convenience and cost are the same, in that a tool being inconvenient means you would need to spend money on training people and making mistakes. I think they are different enough lenses through which to view the question to consider them separate].

As with cost, convenience is contextual and subject to your judgment. In the case of blockchains, we could imagine a company that hires a developer to build a loyalty points system akin to air miles. The developer has two options for building their points database:

1. Build a non-blockchain system that keeps track of which users have how many points
2. Build a blockchain token that represents the loyalty points

To someone who doesn't work with blockchains, the easy answer is: 1. It's simple, cost-effective, and it's how it has always been done. There is even a good chance you've built something like it in the past. To an expert blockchain smart contract developer, building a blockchain-based token system takes hardly any effort at all. And the idea of having to set up, maintain, and secure an SQL database just sparks anxiety.

So long as the long and short-term costs are comparative, it is perfectly fine to decide to use blockchains purely because it is convenient in your specific business context.
