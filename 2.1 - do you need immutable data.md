# Do you need immutable data?

Mutability means changing. In the sense of "the monster is mutating". Immutable means something cannot be mutated, in other words: it cannot be changed. A core characteristic of data on a blockchain is that it is immutable: once written it cannot be changed. Mostly.

## Mutability is always a spectrum

Whether something can be changed depends on the context. For example:

- colouring your hair is a mutable action: you can change it tomorrow
- getting a tattoo is immutable: you can't erase it

The astute reader will note that both of these things are approximately, but not entirely true. After all, if you bleach your hair too many times it will break and fall off of your head, and if you really want to you can kind of undo a tattoo with lasers.

Whether something is immutable is always a function of how far you need to go in order to change something. For example:

- the color of your eyes is immutable; unless you are willing to have eye-replacement surgery
- your genetic code is immutable: unless you are able to find a crazy scientist to apply experimental CRISPR/Cas9 gene therapy to you and risk turning into a puddle of goo
- the strength of Earth's gravity is immutable: unless you are willing and able to take out the core of the planet and shoot it into outer space (and kill us all presumably)

The same is true in computer science: some things are designed to be mutable, others to be immutable.

## Blockchain history cannot be altered

In principle, every time we update a blockchain with a new block (a new spreadsheet page), that block is only valid so long as the whole history down to the first block can be verified to be unchanged.

This is done through really cool cryptography that you don't need to understand but should absolutely Google if you want to geek out on it.

Blockchains as they are commonly understood do not have an admin account that can go back and change things. This is contrary to something like a bank depositor database: if a bank wants to change your account balance there is only their policy and the law stopping them.

In our previous spreadsheet analogy: you can only ever create a new sheet with new data, but never take an old sheet and change it.

## Blockchain history can totally be altered

Remember: immutability is a spectrum. The reason we say blockchains are immutable is that changing the data on them is not feasible in the vast majority of cases.

If the government of Totalitariland decides to steal the money of all the evil Blue-Eyed People they can simply tell all the banks: send the money, this is the law now.

On a blockchain, the rulers of Totalitariland would need to convince everyone involved with the blockchain holding a user's asset records to play along. Given that large blockchains have parties involved all across the world, this is unlikely to happen.

That is not to say it has never happened. If at any point a large group of stakeholders in a blockchain ecosystem decide to change course, they can do so. One notable example is the 2016 Ethereum hard fork.

At this point, the amount of people you'd need to convince to change the most decentralised blockchains is so large and varied that in practice we just say: "Data on blockchains is immutable".

> In 2015 the Ethereum blockchain launched, in 2016 a lot of speculators put their money into a shared account that was hacked (it's more complicated than that, but close enough). After much debate, the solution was a general consensus of "let's just rewrite history and take the money back". I remember the heated debates at the time about whether doing this would be against the ethos of blockchains, with many claiming it would ring a bell you can't unring. A decision like that would be much harder to make now, as back then the amount of people involved in the Ethereum blockchain was so small that communicating on Reddit and a few online forums was enough to create a rough consensus. As of the time of writing the [market cap of public crypto assets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/global-charts) is over a trillion dollars, a world away from when that decision was feasible to make.

### Updating and undoing are not the same

One interesting nuance: the previously mentioned USDC token can freeze user funds. We'll cover more on why this matters in the trustlessness chapter. For the sake of immutability, the most important thing is to know that changes that Circle can make on behalf of USDC users are not rewriting history and thus violating immutability. Instead, they gave themselves permission to issue updates to user accounts in **future** records, in essence allowing them to change things on behalf of users.

What does immutability mean in this context? Two things:

- when they created the rules of the USDC token (which as the creators they are allowed to), those rules cannot be changed because they are immutable[^Unless of course one of the rules they added is that they are allowed to change the rules, computerscience is funny like that.]
- that the record of Circle freezing a user's funds is an action that will forevermore be recorded immutably on the blockchain, and the record of them taking that action cannot be changed.

## If you don't want immutability, you don't want a blockchain

The immutability of blockchains comes at a cost: every actor that keeps a copy of the blockchain data needs to keep a record of the full history. That kind of requirement is going to increase the cost of using the system.

Let's say you want to create a project that allows people to save their profile pictures on a blockchain. You could definitely do so, and a "blockchain-powered image system" sure sounds sophisticated. But the ramifications of doing this mean that once someone uploads a picture, it is on the blockchain forever.

Do you really want that? What if they upload a nude picture of a person who did not consent to having that picture taken or shared?

Outside of blockchain world, this is not a problem. If this happens on any of the big social media platforms there is someone in the company that has a "delete this" button available to them. Once something is added to a blockchain ledger, it is immutable. And you might not need that, or even want it.

> When I was a university student, there used to be an app called Rainmaker. It allowed you to link your contacts app to your social media accounts. Back then the social APIs would still allow you to get the emails and phone numbers of your friends, so by linking my Facebook, Linkedin, and Twitter accounts I would always have the most up-to-date contact details of all my friends! Alas, all social apps decided to lock down their APIs and Rainmaker went out of business. Their business went down because the social media APIs were mutable. I'm not saying social apps should have stagnant APIs, but I do think it's interesting that if you build an application that interfaces with an immutable blockchain app, you can have a guarantee that your app will continue working until the blockchain itself stops working, which ideally is never.

## Example: tamperproof audits

Because blockchains are immutable, I can prove with certainty where the money in my crypto wallet came from. Not only that, but you can see where the people who sent me money got their money ad infinitum. And all with near certainty that those records are correct unless the whole world conspired to change them and you are the only one kept in the dark.

Contrary to traditional accounting, there is no way for a blockchain wallet user to fake their account balance or transaction history.

You might have opinions about whether this is good or bad, but the fact remains: this level of certainty is impossible to get in the traditional financial system. In the legacy banking system, it is common to be asked for a PDF of a document as proof of various things.

After the EU implemented stricter anti-money laundering rules, a lot of citizens in my country were asked to provide "proof of source of funds" in the form of PDF documents. The fraud sensitivity of this system baffles me. They are pixels on a screen that offer "proof" only because the person looking at them trusts them.
