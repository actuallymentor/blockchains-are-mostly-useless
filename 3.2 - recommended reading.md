# Recommended reading

This book explicitly did not go into the underlying technology of blockchains. If you want to learn more about the underlying technologies, this section will provide some starting points for diving deeper. This section contains not only reading material but also audio and video.

Please note that it is challenging to give canonical "getting started" resources. The fact is that the world of blockchains is in constant flux. Things are complicated by the fact that there is often money involved, and with money come people who care a great deal about specific technologies and approaches.

As a general rule, I would caution: the loudest voices should be analysed with the maximum scepticism.

## Understanding the basic technology

If you want to start playing with blockchains, there are some media groups and apps that specialise in teaching you. One of those is called Bankless, which is a duo that creates podcast episodes and writes articles. They maintain a [repository of guides](https://www.bankless.com/read/topic/guides). To get started, I recommend looking at:

- [Guide to MetaMask](https://www.bankless.com/guide-to-metamask) to get to know the most used browser wallet
- [Guide to Uniswap](https://www.bankless.com/the-bankless-guide-to-uniswap) to understand the quintessential decentralised exchange
- [Guide to Maker Dai](https://www.bankless.com/the-bankless-guide-to-dai) to understand the first decentralised stablecoin

The Ethereum Foundation maintains a good repository of Ethereum-related learning articles at their [learning hub](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/). Regardless of whether your interest is in Ethereum specifically, it is a good starting point to understand basic concepts. Some recommended places to start:

- [What is Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) covers many questions like "What can it do" but also "What is the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin"
- [Ethereum in 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UihMqcj-cqc) a video by the Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin explaining the basics of Ethereum
- [Decentralised finance (DeFi)](https://ethereum.org/en/defi/) explains what decentralised finance is, and under what circumstances it can add value

A community-run addition to the Ethereum foundation materials is [Ethspring](https://ethspring.com/), which maintains a list of resources and text.

## Using the basic technology

The best way to learn how to use blockchains and their applications is to try them out. There are a few "how to get started" platforms that offer "quests" for you to try. One of these is [learncrypto.com](https://academy.learncrypto.com/quests), which features how to get started with guides like:

- [Get a wallet](https://academy.learncrypto.com/quests/get-a-wallet)
- [Customise your wallet](https://academy.learncrypto.com/quests/customise-your-wallet)
- [Buy crypto from your Web3 wallet](https://academy.learncrypto.com/quests/buy-crypto-web3wallet)
- [Swap crypto at a DEX](https://academy.learncrypto.com/quests/swap-crypto-at-a-dex)

I'd also recommend some safety-related articles like [How to identify scam tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/guides/how-to-id-scam-tokens/).

## About adoption by criminals and regular people

Blockchain assets have a reputation for being used by speculators and criminals. And those two demographics use the technology for sure. Reading about the specifics, however, will allow you to engage in dialogue around this more intelligently. Some interesting resources by topic:

- Criminal usage statistics
    - [The Chanialysis crypto crime report series](https://go.chainalysis.com/2023-crypto-crime-report.html) tracks the significant illicit activity on blockchains, the nice thing about public ledgers is that we can analyse criminal funds in real-time. The 2022 estimate of value received by illicit addresses is $20.6 billion. They also track how that relates to all cryptocurrency transaction volume. In 2022 illicit activity accounted for 0.24% of all activity[^Since the analysis started in 2017 the number has hovered between roughly 0.2% and 2%].
    - [Europol report: Cryptocurrencies: tracing the evolution of criminal finances](https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-events/publications/cryptocurrencies-tracing-evolution-of-criminal-finances#downloads) gives a law-enforcement oriented perspective on the illicit use of blockchain assets. They quote higher percentages than the chainalysis report[^They note that "Research agrees that the proportion of cryptocurrency use associated with illicit activities compared to legitimate use decreased over time while the absolute amount has continued to increase. The illicit use of cryptocurrencies is predominantly associated with money laundering purposes, the (online) trade of illicit goods and services, and fraud."]
- About stablecoins and their adoption/backing
    - ["State of the USDC Economy" Report](https://www.circle.com/reports/state-of-the-usdc-economy) is an analysis of the company behind USDC covering what their stablecoin is used for, and how it is changing over time
    - [The 10-Minute Guide to Tether Reserves](https://dirtroads.substack.com/p/55-the-10-minute-guide-to-tether?utm_source=tldr_crypto) is an interesting dive into the (far less transparent) Tether stable coin and what we know about the reserves they claim to have and how they use them

## Diving deeper into the underlying technologies

Most blockchain-based systems and tokens publish a whitepaper where they describe the way they intend their systems to work. Most of the time they tend to be quite technical, but are easy enough to skim. I would recommend starting by reading these. Instead of reading the works of those who have views and opinions on a system, start with the "purest" source material.

Note that many of these can get technical. If you don't understand a concept in a whitepaper, you can choose to either go down the rabbit hole and look it up, or just skip it and stick to a high-level understanding. Even if you only understand the basics, having read these whitepapers you will likely understand more about cryptoeconomics than most people on Twitter.

I'd recommend you try to read:

- [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper) to understand how the world of cryptocurrencies got started. The basic ideas behind a blockchain as a ledger, and why it was conceived in the first place
- [Ethereum whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) to understand why the basic model of Bitcoin limits the applications that a blockchain can be used for.
- [Makerdao multi-collateral Dai whitepaper](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#introduction) to understand how an over-collateralised stablecoin run on a smart-contract blockchain works
- [Uniswap V3 whitepaper](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf) to understand how decentralised exchanges (in this case as a liquidity pool) work without the need for trust

If you want to dive a bit deeper into relatively recent developments on the technical and crypto-economic front, I recommend reading:

- On the topic of Proof of Stake, the low-energy alternative to Proof of Work mining
    - [Proof-of-stake (POS) by the Ethereum foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)
    - [What proof of stake is and why it matters by Vitalik Buterin (2013)](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/what-proof-of-stake-is-and-why-it-matters-1377531463)
    - [Ethereum PoS Attack and Defense (2022)](https://mirror.xyz/jmcook.eth/YqHargbVWVNRQqQpVpzrqEQ8IqwNUJDIpwRP7SS5FXs)
- Zero-knowledge cryptography
    - [Understanding Zero-knowledge proofs through illustrated examples](https://blog.goodaudience.com/understanding-zero-knowledge-proofs-through-simple-examples-df673f796d99)
    - [What are ZK-SNARKs?](https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/)

## Learning how to program smart contracts and dApps

The Ethereum Foundation maintains a [developer-centric page](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/learning-tools/) with tools, guides, boot camps, and documentation. Below I'll highlight some of my favorites.

If you are a programmer and want to learn about smart contracts, I highly recommend [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/). It is an interactive online course in Solidity, the language that powers Ethereum smart contracts.

If you are looking for a less comprehensive and more project-based approach [Speedrun Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/) is a great place to find projects you can build as learning experiences. Their getting started challenges:

- [Build a decentralised staking app](https://speedrunethereum.com/challenge/decentralized-staking)
- [Make a simple NFT](https://speedrunethereum.com/challenge/simple-nft-example)
- [Token vending machine](https://speedrunethereum.com/challenge/decentralized-staking)

Another similar and well-liked platform is [eth.build](https://eth.build/) which hosts a visual playground you can use to get acquainted with blockchain technology from a developer perspective.

The best way to learn is to build something, and I highly recommend that you do. Do keep in mind that the tooling tends to change a lot, so prepare for a highly dynamic field.
