# Preface

I've had a lot of fun in blockchain world. It's now 2023, which marks the 10th anniversary of my first Bitcoin purchase. At the time I was a student with a tight budget, who knew nothing about finance, and only a little more about computer programming. Before we dive into the meat of this book, I'd like to take you along for some short stories that might help put you in the mind space I was in at the time.

> My writing tends to be very terse. The chapters after this have less story and more theory than this preface. For those of you who prefer textbooks over fiction books, you can skip this chapter. It's ok Ben, Bas, and Tom. I won't be offended.

## The sextoy superhero

It's February 2013. I'm still pretty sure I'm going to be a biologist working in a lab in a few years. But being an excitable twentysomething I joined an event called "3-day startup", which was exactly what it sounds like: we tried to build a start-up company over a weekend. One thing led to another, and now I'm helping organise one of such events and get invited to all the events where future synergistic disrupting 10x unicorn founders hang out. One of those was the Kairos Society summit in New York City.

After raising money from my Dutch family by asking for donations and offering to give massages and build websites, I now find myself in a workshop session on the New York Stock Exchange floor. On my left is a tall man with very impressive eyebrows. On my right a blond lady from a US newspaper who seems to know him. The rest of the table is filled with other twentysomethings excited to win some sort of brainstorming competition. The topic of conversation: the potential of 3D-printing to change the world.

About 10 minutes in, amazing eyebrow man thinks we're thinking too inside the box. He with a straight face says "what about personalised 3D-printed sex toys"? Mind you I am a Dutch kid, I find this a bit weird but I'm not uncomfortable. The others around the table seem much more shocked, but seem not to want to offend this guy. At the end of the session, he tells a bunch of us "You should join my summer program in California"! I didn't think much of it, but I signed up for the summer programs email list.

Turns out sextoy man was Tim Draper. European little me had no idea his grandfather started the first venture capital firm. If Silicon Valley had royalty, I imagine the Draper line would have a well-known coat of arms.

Later that year I'm in a car, driving from Denmark back to the Netherlands, after joining my younger brother on a trampolining competition (I had given up the sport a year or two prior). I get an email, reminding me to sign up for the Draper University summer program. Price tag: a few thousand Euros. More than the tuition fees of my undergraduate degree combined. My mother who is driving makes brief eye contact through the rearview mirror: "niet geschoten altijd mis Ment"[^Dutch saying: 'If you did not shoot, then you missed'].

A few months later I am in San Mateo, close to San Francisco, in a converted hotel building. Draper University agreed to lower my tuition to an affordable amount after I offered to teach people to build websites and hold their breath for a few minutes, a trick I learned a few years prior. Someone on the admissions committee must have thought "Let's add a wildcard to the mix". I am forever grateful for my experiences there.

One of which was Tim handing out these gold-coloured coins to guest speakers. Coins with a QR code on them. Coins that I learned had a Bitcoin attached to them.

Rabbit hole unlocked.

## It's not illegal if it's in Panama

It's dark and I need to pee. My girlfriend's student lodgings are much nicer than mine, so I basically live there now. I have a drawer and everything, epic win. I make my way to the bathroom and grab my phone because at this point I had not developed digital hygiene habits yet. I sit down and open havelockinvestments.com.

At this point I'm rich. Sure, I have â‚¬20,000 in student debt, but I also have more than that in Bitcoin mining stocks. If I chose to pay off my student debt today, I would have enough left over to buy a second-hand car. It's the most wealth I've ever had. I started with a few hundred Euros, and now I have this. I guess I have a knack for investing.

I'm staring at my feet waiting for the page to load and show me the value of my portfolio. Havelock Investments is situated in Panama for legal reasons, so I forgive them for having a website that is a bit slow. Where else am I going to use my Bitcoins to buy stocks in companies that will give me more Bitcoins?

The page loads. I can't wait to see the value of my Peta mine shares. That Belgian solar-powered datacenter is my ticket to epic financial gains. Me and my brother bought shares in them a while back, betting that our investing acumen would turn our portfolios into a way to not only pay off our student debt but maybe even a downpayment for a house!

Aaand it's gone. The website broke again. I forgive this cutting-edge Bitcoin-powered stock exchange for having occasional outages. I go back to bed, I'm sure they'll fix the website tomorrow.

The sun rises, the world lights up, and so does my phone screen. Plot twist. The website is fine. It's my portfolio that's not. My net worth is negative again. I guess I shouldn't trust Belgians.

## 1,000 ETH, and you can't get at it

I'm in a lecture pretending to make notes. In reality, I'm preparing to leave for a freelance gig and trying to hack a crypto wallet at the same time. I message my brother "Tried 937 password combos. I don't think it's your ***-based password".

My brother is freaking out a bit. It's been years since we learned hard lessons with Havelock Investments, and at the time we invested the Bitcoins we had left into the first-of-its-kind crypto crowd sale. We kind of expected the 19-year-old we gave our Bitcoins to would never manage to create the Ethereum system he wanted to make. But hey, this is the future and ETH officially exists and is worth about $1 per token.

At the time of the Ethereum crowd sale, you would transfer Bitcoin to an address and give them your email. They would then email you the cryptographic key needed to create your Ethereum wallet if they managed to make the system. It took two years, but that little .json attachment in the email is now worth money. And my brother forgot the password he encrypted it with.

The 1,000 ETH locked in his little .json file is now worth $1000. It's the kind of money we don't just have lying around. Let alone that we could invest in a cryptocurrency. My brother has a $1000 lottery ticket[^In 2023 that unencrypted wallet file would be worth a million or more.] and can't access it.

It's been a few weeks. And while we didn't manage to unlock the wallet, at least I learned a bit about how brute-forcing encrypted files works. I now know what Euclidian distance is and how to code a script to use it to try to break cryptographic locks. The operative word here is "try" of course.

A week or so after that fateful message to my brother he calls me. I pick up and am greeted not with "hello" but "I HAVE IT". Turns out a few special characters can be the difference between you and your ETH. We sure learned a lot about backing up our cryptographic private keys since then.

## I guess I'm a filthy capitalist now

We're at the Euronext[^The Dutch stock exchange, which is ["the oldest "modern" securities market in the world"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronext_Amsterdam).] building in the IPO room. Tables are set up in a square, roundtable style. We're having a glass of wine. The only thing missing to fulfil some stereotypes is some cigars and misogynistic jokes. But it's 2021, so instead half the attendees wear hoodies and the percentage of women is not 0%.

We're hosted by our friend Wilhelm, who graciously invited us to this venue to celebrate the 8th anniversary of our WhatsApp group "The Investors", formerly "Bitcoin Bazen". What started as a group of nitwits who got excited about Bitcoin, and is now filled with everything from crypto fund managers, blockchain techies, and people who really should spend less time on Youtube. We have the collective pretention that we talk about all things investing, but it's mostly our mutual "finger on the pulse" for the crypto markets.

The evening is filled with everything from investing takes to ethical discussions. The crypto fund people are asked about what legislation they see coming, the police force employee is asked about his view on crypto and law enforcement, and we all share what we are excited about in the coming months.

It's roundabout this time I concluded that blockchain tech is no longer a hobby. At this point, my main work is at a company using blockchain tech and my younger brother runs a crypto fund. The people around us are no longer naive twentysomethings who think they know what they are talking about. We're now mostly naive thirtysomethings who are not sure if there are any adults in the room. We speak the language of the finance industry, know more about the dynamics of money creation than the average banker, and think that investing money is a hobby. The outside world would look into the room and see little monopoly men and women.

## Am I grumpy grandpa?

When me and my wife are at a dinner party, we have the rule that I'm not allowed to start any conversation about blockchains, but I'm allowed to jump in if someone else starts one. And at this point, I mostly hope they don't, because in 50% of cases I need to explain that I'm not a con artist and a climate change denier, and the other 50% I have to deal with crypto bros who have been around the crypto industry "for a long time" (average 1-3 years). I'm in my thirties, but I feel like the grumpy grandpa in many of these cases shaking my proverbial fists at the world that doesn't understand how blockchains and financial markets work.

There is one "grumpy grandpa moment" that contributed greatly to the creation of this book. My favourite finance podcast [Rational Reminder](https://rationalreminder.ca/) did a series of episodes on crypto. When they announced it I was super excited: finally, some smart and nonbiased people were going to cover my industry, amazing! Much blockchain-related media is complete nonesense, and I was looking forward to having a no-nonsense view of the industry by Ben and Cameron.

With every episode I listened to though, I became more incredulous. Sure, some podcast guests were very smart finance researchers covering an aspect of crypto investing. But the people they had on who talked about the technical aspects seemed to have no idea what they were talking about. Or maybe that is not fair, if it was 2018 they would have been entirely correct. But it seemed like they made up their minds then, and did not follow any developments since then.

They made arguments like "crypto cannot be a payment rail, it is too volatile and expensive". Meanwhile, at that time stablecoins (tokens that are worth exactly $1) were doing $40 **billion** in transfers per day, with a transaction costing a couple of dollars in Ethereum, and a couple of cents on well-established Layer 2 networks. Another guest confidently states that overcollateralised stable coins cannot work, while Maker has maintained the [Dai](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai) stablecoin peg since 2019[^All stablecoins fluctuate slightly, which is by design and relates to their creation/redemption mechanic.]. A few years since that podcast episode, stablecoins settled $12 **trillion** per day[^This fluctuated wildly of course. You can view [the daily stats here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins)].

Now don't get me wrong, the crypto industry is full of frauds and con artists. The largest stablecoin currently is Tether, and it's an ongoing controversy whether they are a legit company or committing fraud. Mostly because they refuse to release audits. I have many and nuanced opinions about things like that. But I will concede: if you search online for blockchain-related media content, you will find the voices that scream loudest. And those are more likely to be con artists than the tech-savvy crypto people who live in a bubble of their own.

This little book is my attempt to add a voice that is staunchly pro of anti-crypto, but thinks that like in all things nuance matters.
